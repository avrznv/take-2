2. **What is the role of a helper in nodejs server architecture?** *=> 2 points*

15. **Export keyword in nodejs code** *=> 4 points*
export keyword uses for export a function or an object from file or module
 
## Part II: Practice on paper *=> 45 points*

*No restrictions on online resources usage. You also may use your development machine for assistance in debugging if needed.*

16. **You received a bug stating the following: "Intermittemtly this method results in an exception in the command line reporting of a Null reference." You're required to find and fix the problem in this method:** *=> 10 points*

		public static addWeeks(date: Date, value: number): Date {
            date.setDate(date.getDate() + (value * 7));
            return date;
        }

17. **Having the following DB tables diagram:** *=> 10 points*

![](https://github.com/lentyaishe/masa-exam-2/blob/dev/resources/db-schema.jpg)

You need to write a query that returns for each user a full data. Consider that not every user in the system has an employee record. In such a case out put "Not an employee". Create By column should include the full name of the user that created the record of this an output user:

| Full name | Created By | Position |
| --- | --- | -- |
| John Doe | Mark Smith | Manager |
| Mary Smith | Klark Smith | Cashier |
| Patrice Raymond | Not an eployee |  |

18. **Write a method in JS/TS that gets as an argument 2 dates and returns a boolean value of whether those dates share the same month**. *=> 5 points*

public static mounthDiff(date1:Date, date2:Date):boolean{
        return (date1.getMonth() == date2.getMonth())
    }

19. **Explain the following piece of code:** *=> 5 points*

        public static dictionaryToArrayOfObjects<T>(input: _.Dictionary<T>): T[] {
            return _.map(Object.getOwnPropertyNames(input), (key: string) => input[key]);
        }

20. **Fix the following code and fill the required gaps in it by the coding standards. The purpose of this code is to verify the user is a member of a specific role and in case the user is, a true return value should be returned by the isUserPermitted() method, otherwise false. Treat the comments as actual code written that should not be changed.** *=> 15 points*

  interface user {
    id: number;
    firstName: string;
    lastName: string;
    roles: role;
  }
  
  interface dbUser {
    id: number;
    first_name: string;
    last_name: string;
    role_id: number;
    role_title
  }

  interface role {
    id: number;
    title: string;
  }

  enum Role {
    Administrator = 1,
    RegularUser
  }
  public isUserPermitted(userId: number, roles: Role[]): Promise<bool> {
    return new Promise<bool>((resolve, reject) => {
      Promise.all([
        this.getUser(userId), this.getRole(roles)
      ])
      .then((result: user, roles:role[]) => {
        if (roles.some(item => result.roles.includes(item))){
        resolve(result)
        }
        else{
            reject("Not permited")
        }
    });
  }
}
  
  private getUser(userId: number): Promise<user> {
    return new Promise<user>((resolve, reject) => {
   
  }

  private getRole(roles:role[]): Promise<role[]> {
    return new Promise<role[]>((resolve, reject) => {
    });


## Part III: Practice on dev machine *=> 33 points*

*No restrictions on online resources usage*

 - Clone the repository: https://github.com/lentyaishe/masa-exam-2;
 - Switch to `broken-server` branch;
 - Create a new git repository under your personal Github called `masa-exam-2`;
 - Load the `main` branch of your new repository with the contents of the `broken-server` branch;
 - Each bug in the list should be solved in designated branch.

The following is the list of currently existing problems with the system. :

21. **The server solution cannot be compiled. Fix all compilation issues accordingly.** *=> 10 points*

22. **An attempt to start the server fails reporting "RangeError [ERR_SOCKET_BAD_PORT]: options.port should be >= 0 and < 65536. Received NaN".** *=> 8 points*
